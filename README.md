Just another website for Swaathi Kakarla (married to Karthik Kamalakannan)
========

Runs on Jekyll with help from the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme.

# What is Hyde?

Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
