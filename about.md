I'm a 24 year old business owner, I've been running [Skcript]({{ site.skcript.main }}) for about {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2013 }} years now. I work with 9 other [amazing people]({{ site.skcript.people }}) everyday to build our compression server for the enterprise, [SHRINK]({{ site.skcript.shrink }}) and our work management tool, [Allt]({{ site.skcript.allt }}).

I fell in love with code when I was 15 years old, and it still hasn't changed. Currently Ruby and Python are my addictions. I dabble a bit in server management, a lot in machine learning, and in everything that keeps me curious. Also love to speak about code, tech and startups. There are a few people I admire on the internet, you should [check them out](/people)!

Perpetually trying to make a dent in the universe from the "spicy" side of the equator. Namaste. üôè
