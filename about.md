Hey! Thanks for stopping by.

I'm a 23 year old business owner, I've been running [Skcript]({{ site.skcript.main }}) for about {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2013 }} years now. I work with 4 other [amazing people]({{ site.skcript.people }}) everyday to build our compression server for the enterprise, [SHRINK]({{ site.skcript.shrink }}) and our work management tool, [Allt]({{ site.skcript.allt }}).

I fell in love with code when I was 15 years old, and it still hasn't changed. Currently Ruby and Python are my addictions. I dabble a bit in server management, machine learning, and anything that keeps me curious. Also love to speak about code, tech and startups.

Perpetually trying to make a dent in the universe from the "spicy" side of the equator. Namaste. üôè
